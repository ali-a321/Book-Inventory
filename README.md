# Book-Inventory
(IN-PROGRESS) 
Built with React, Node.js, Express, and MySQL, this book website enables users to explore, purchase, and manage books. It offers CRUD functionality for book data and includes a price filter for refined searches. User authentication provides users access to features like placing orders and viewing their order history for the current day. The website features a shopping cart and highlights the best-selling books based on the top 5 points assigned through the "Add book" form submissions.
